- I am an applied mathematician working at the intersection of mathematics and medicine. I'm interested in mathematical biology, specifically in using mathematics to understand the role of heterogeneity in disease progression. 
- 
- I am currently a lecturer in mathematical biology in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds. Before my current position, I was a senior scientist in the Oncology Research Unit of Pfizer, Inc, a postdoctoral research associate in the Theoretical Biology group at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a Junior Fellow at the Mittag-Leffler Institute, and completed my PhD at McGill University. 
-
- Outside of research, I enjoy running, skiing, and cooking. The Rocky Mountains are one of my favorite places on earth and I have an ever growing to-do list of hikes.
