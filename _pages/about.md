 I am an applied mathematician working at the intersection of mathematics and medicine. My research typically uses mathematical models and approaches from applied mathematics to understand how intrapatient heterogeneity drives disease progression. I am also interested in translating patient specific insights into population level treatment strategies. 

 I am currently a Lecturer in Mathematical Biology in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds. Before my current role, I was a senior scientist in the Oncology Research Unit of Pfizer Inc., a postdoctoral research associate in the Theoretical Biology group at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and a Junior Fellow at the Mittag-Leffler Institute. I completed my PhD at McGill University. 

 Outside of research, I enjoy running, skiing, and cooking. The Rocky Mountains are one of my favorite places on earth and I have an ever growing to-do list of hikes.
