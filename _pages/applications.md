The application process for scholarships, fellowships, and academic positions can be frustratingly opaque. I share some of my application materials (with corresponding outcomes) in the hopes that it may help to demystify the application process (while being a single sample representative of my extreme good fortune and privilege).

### Fellowships during graduate school

NSERC PGS-D (2016): This application was unsuccessful at the department level [link](https://ttcassid.github.io/files/Application_Materials/PGSD_Application_2016.pdf)

NSERC PGS-D (2017): This application was successful [link](https://ttcassid.github.io/files/Application_Materials/NSERCPGSDTylerCassidyApplication2017.pdf)

### Postdoctoral fellowships 

Near the end of my PhD, I applied for ~25 postdoctoral positions, including 8 Junior Research Fellowships at Oxford and Cambridge and an industrial postdoctoral position. I had 6 interviews of varying levels of formality and received 6 offers. Most applications asked for on a CV and cover letter. The cover letter I submitted for my position at LANL is here [link](https://ttcassid.github.io/files/Application_Materials/LosAlamosStatementOfInterest.pdf).

Applicants could only apply once for the NSERC postdoctoral fellowship when I finished my PhD (in 2018). I decided to apply in 2019 with a year of postdoctoral experience at LANL.

### Academic and Industrial Job Search

In 2020, I applied to 6 tenure track positions, primarily at research institutions in Canada, and had 1 Skype interview for an academic position. I withdrew from that search to take an industrial research position.

The application for my industrial position only required a cover letter [link](https://ttcassid.github.io/files/Application_Materials/Pfizer_Cover_Letter.pdf)

In 2021, I applied to 19 tenure track positions, 10 at primary undergraduate institutions and 9 at research institutions, starting late in the application cycle. I had 5 interviews and received 2 offers. I withdrew from 3 interviews to take my current position. I only interviewed at Mathematical Biology specific positions.
