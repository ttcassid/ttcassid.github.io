I am searching for prospective research students and postdocs. If you're interested in working together, please feel free to get in touch via email. I am particularly happy to hear from undergraduate and MSc students who are interested in learning more about using quantitative tools to answer questions in medicine and biology. 

For prospective PhD students, please include a few sentence description of your background, research interests, and CV. Mathematical biology is an transdisciplinary field and I am very happy to hear from kind and curious students from a variety of quantitative backgrounds.

I am very happy to support potential PhD students and postdocs in applying for personal fellowships. Please get in touch at least a month before application deadlines so we have sufficient advance notice to prepare funding applications. 

Possible PhD projects through the University of Leeds can be found here:
