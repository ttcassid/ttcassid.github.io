I am searching for prospective research students and postdocs. If you're interested in working together, please feel free to get in touch via email. Please include a few sentence description of your background, research interests, and CV. Mathematical biology is an transdisciplinary field and I am very happy to hear from kind and curious students from a variety of quantitative backgrounds.

I am very happy to support potential postdocs in applying for personal fellowships together. Please get in touch at least a month before application deadlines so we have sufficient advance notice to prepare funding applications. 

### Past Supervision

 * Peter Gillich, NSERC-USRA and Honours Research Project on numerical methods for Gamma distributed delay differential equations, McGill University. Next position: M.Sc Data Science at University of Waterloo
