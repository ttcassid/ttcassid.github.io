I base my teaching philosophy on the axioms written by Federico Ardila [link]([https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf]):

Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

These statements should sound self-evident, but remain a pressing call to action.

The Being Human In STEM cirriculum has particularly impacted my thinking [link](https://www.beinghumaninstem.com/readings.html)
